# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to assist Bobby an employee of Pewlett Hackard in answering some questions for the company such as how many employees are ready to retire since the company is providing a retirement package and how many employees are eligible for a mentorship program so the company can prepare for the future.
## Results
- By looking at employees whose birth date is between the years of 1952 and 1955, we discover there are many employees that are ready to retire and were able to see there are many different positions retiring
- By looking at the table showing the count of each title that is retiring we can see that there are more senior position employees that are retiring such as the senior engineers and senior staff compared to the starter positions such as assistant engineer and manager as shown below:

- Based on the mentorship eligibility table we can see there are over 1000 employees that are eligible for the mentorship program
- Based on the mentorship eligibility table we can see there are multiple positions eligible for mentorship but we cannot tell through this table how many of each position
## Summary
Overall, there are over 40,000 roles that will need to be filled as the silver Tsunami begins to impact Pewlett Hackard. There are over a 1000 qualified employees that are able to mentor the next generation of employees which means each individual would need to mentor more than one new employee. However, looking a little deeper into the data and knowing that we need mroe staff that are eligible to mentor the more senior positions, out of the 1000 only 372 are senior engineers which is the highest number of employees needed to be replaced. The table below demonstrates the breakdown count of the eligible mentors by title:

Also, looking at the data from a department persepective and the total number of individuals retiring per department we can see the development, production and sales are the ones that will be most affected by the silver tsunami as seen below:

This is a high risk for the company because without the development, production and sales the company will suffer and so will all the other departments as they are connected to these.
